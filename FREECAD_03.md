## 3D Printing Workflow

1. Select at least one body
2. Export to .STL
3. Load into your slicer application
4. Convert to G-Code and send it to your printer

## What are the core parts?

- .STL File: 3D mesh of your object
- Slicer application
   - Allows for last-minute customizations (print multiples, scaling)
   - Add support structures
   - Optimizes the mesh for your 3D-printer (filament, nozzle size, etc.)
   - Converts your 3D mesh to G-code
