# What is FreeCAD?

## What is CAD?

Computer-Assisted Design

üîë Key Aspects of CAD:

- **Parametric modeling**: Define shapes with dimensions and constraints that can be updated later.
- **2D & 3D design**: Supports both technical drawings (2D) and detailed 3D models.
- **Accuracy**: CAD models are mathematically precise, unlike hand sketches or artistic models.
- **Documentation**: CAD can generate technical drawings, assembly instructions, or manufacturing files.

---

## The dad-joke analogy

**Photoshop**: Painting on canvas

**Blender**: Painting or Sculpting with clay

**CAD**: Excel for 3D-shapes

---

## FEM - Finite Element Method

Simulate physical behavour of parts and structure under loads, heat, vibrations.

**FreeCAD has support for FEM.**

---

## CAM - Compuer-Aided Manufacturing

Generate machine instructions for manufacturing (CNC machines, G-code)

While FreeCAD has support, it is still recommended to use slicer software for 3D-printing.

- Cura
- PrusaSlicer
- SuperSlicer

# What is parametric CAD?

---

## Definition

Parametric CAD is about **rules & dimensions & relationships** that make your design adaptable and editable.

![sketch example](sketch_example.png)

---

## Examples of parametric modeling

### Specifying dimensions (parameters)

- The rectangle has width 50mm and height 40mm.
- The angle between line A and B is 30¬∞
- The distance between the two lines is 60mm

### Specifying relationships (constraints)

- Line A must always be perpendicular to line B.
- Line C must always be the same length as Line D.
- Point E is point-symmetrical to Point F around Point G.

---

## Fully constrained

A fully constrained sketch means:

The geometry has exactly enough parameters and constraints
to define a geometry without having any degrees of freedom (DoFs).

FreeCAD checks your geometry for DoFs.

---

# Simple FreeCAD workflow for beginners

---

<!-- {"animate-li": true} -->

## Simple FreeCAD workflow

1. Create a sketch geometry
2. (optional but recommended) Make the sketch geometry fully constrained
3. Apply operators to your sketch

---

## DEMO

Simple FreeCAD workflow

---

# FreeCAD getting started

---

## Install FreeCAD

### PopOS

```
sudo apt install freecad
```

### Arch

```
yay install freecad
```


### snap

```
snap install freecad
```

### flatpak
```
flatpak install org.freecad.FreeCAD
```

---

## Settings

### Units & Navigation style

Just use bottom right dropdown

![controls](controls.png)

---

### Available Workbenches

*Edit --> Preferences --> Available Workbenches*

![prefs](preferences.png)

- Disable unneeded Workbenches, we focus today on:
  - Part Design
  - Sketcher
  - Draft
- Workbench selector type: TabBar vs Dropdown

---

## Side-note notable workbenches

### Reverse Engineering

Reverse engineer `.STL` models to FreeCAD.

### Assembly

Assemble multiple parts to visualize mechanics / movement.

### Spreadsheet

Make a spreadsheet with editable data to edit your parts.

# Design a simple cube with FreeCAD

The parametric way

---

## Create a parametric part

![parametric](newfile.png)

---

## Create a sketch

See tasks

![sketch](create_sketch.png)

---

## Select the XY plane

![plane](xy_plane.png)

---

## Create a rectangle

Dimensions: **20mm x 20mm**
Make the rectagle using **Center, width, height**

![rect](sketcher1.png)

**And then close the sketch**

---

## Use your first operation: Pad

Select the sketch and then click on the **Pad** operator.

![pad](pad.png)

---

## Edit the Pad parameters

Set the *length* to **20mm**

![pad](padparams.png)

Congrats! You made your first parametric part!
