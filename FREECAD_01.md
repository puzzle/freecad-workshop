## What is CAD?

Computer-Assisted Design

üîë Key Aspects of CAD:

- Parametric modeling: Define shapes with dimensions and constraints that can be updated later.
- 2D & 3D design: Supports both technical drawings (2D) and detailed 3D models.
- Accuracy: CAD models are mathematically precise, unlike hand sketches or artistic models.
- Documentation: CAD can generate technical drawings, assembly instructions, or manufacturing files.

## The dad-joke analogy

CAD: Excel for 3D-shapes

Blender: Painting or Sculpting with clay

Photoshop: Painting on canvas

## FEM - Finite Element Method

Simulate physical behavour of parts and structure under loads, heat, vibrations.

**FreeCAD has support for FEM.**

---

## CAM - Compuer-Aided Manufacturing

Generate machine instructions for manufacturing (CNC machines, G-code)

While FreeCAD has support, it is still recommended to use slicer software for 3D-printing.
